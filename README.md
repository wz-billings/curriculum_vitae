# Zane's CV

This repo contains my Curriculum Vitae in multiple formats.

* TeX: I originally wrote my CV in LaTeX in a modular format.
* ASCII: I am working on converting my CV into ASCII format once a friend in
computer science convinced me this would be useful (draft).
* Word: I dislike using Word, but this version is specifically for uses where
no other file format is accepted (WIP).
* HTML: I would like to write a version in HTML eventually (WIP).
