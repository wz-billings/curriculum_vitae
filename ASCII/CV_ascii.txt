EDUCATION
=========
- B.S., Mathematics and Biology; GPA: 4.0
  Western Carolina University, Cullowhee NC
  2016 - 2020

RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
===================
- Coan Lab, Western Carolina University; Spring 2016 - Present
  * Examined the ability of keratin to modulate the autophagy pathway in
    human cells
  * Maintained lab cell cultures and prepped cultures for experiments.
  * Optimized transfection of a dual-reporter autophagy biomarker plasmid
    into HEK-293 cells.
  * Visualized changes in the autophagy pathway using wide-field
    epifluorescence microscopy.
  * Compiled and analyzed data using FIJI and R.
  * Project will culminate in a senior thesis in Spring 2020. My proposal,
    "Using epifluorescence microscopy to evaluate the effects of the protein
    keratin on autophagy in HEK-293 cells" was approved by my thesis committee
    at the end of the 2019 Spring semester.
- Handel Research Group, University of Georgia; Summer 2019
  * Participated in the 2019 REU sit Population Biology of Infectious Diseases
    at the University of Georgia, and was funded by the NIH.
  * Cleaned and joined a complex data set (taken from a relational database)
    from a 2016 - 2017 study at the University of Georgia Student Health Center.
    (Data used was from this study: https://www.jabfm.org/content/32/2/226 .)
  * Analyzed the impact of cross-sectional qPCR measurements of relative viral
    load at point-of-care facilities on Influenza A diagnosis and prognosis.
  * Modeled and visualized the relationships between several study variables
    using R, and presented results via R-Markdown (and Pagedown).
- Bobay Research Group, University of North Carolina at Greensboro; Summer 2018
  * Participated in the 2018 REU sit Math-Biology at UNCG, funded by the NSF.
  * Constructed a probabilistic model for determining the probability of any
    number of convergent mutations between bacterial genomes.
  * Verified the accuracy of the probability statement using Monte-Carlo
    simulation methods with Python.
  * Visualized model predictions, effects of parameters, and simulation results
    using R. (Some minor work was additionally done in MATLAB.)
- Kwochka Lab, Western Carolina University; Fall 2017 - Spring 2018
  * Synthesized complex organic chemicals; namely phenylboronic acid derivatives
    and complexes of these chemicals with Lewis bases.
  * Analyzed the properties of these complexes for rotational activity to screen
    for potential molecular rotor components.
  * Confirmed identity of samples using H-NMR, C-NMR, H-H Homonuclear COSY, IR,
    and GC/MS methods.
- Hyman Lab, Western Carolina University; Summer 2016
  * Participated in WCU's SURP (Summer Undergraduate Research Program) in 2016
    for incoming freshman, fully funded by WCU.
  * Observed behavior of song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) males in both rural
    and urban environments to compare differences in aggression and boldness
    between habitats.
  * Performed song playback experiments to quantify aggressive song sparrow
    behavior in the field.
- OEIS contributions
  * Author of sequence A319302 (https://oeis.org/A319302).
  * Author of sequence A309092 (https://oeis.org/A309092).
  * Wrote Python code and generated a b-file of terms for sequence A110529
    (https://oeis.org/A110529).
